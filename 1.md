## zip

### zip builtin

`zip` is a Python builtin (meaning you can use it like that, without importing anything). It is a pretty neat tool if you work with iterable stuff, like lists.

Suppose you have two lists. The first one has names, the second one has values:
```python
names = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]
```

If you want to iterate over the two lists in a way that you will get `('a', 1)` then `('b', 2)`..., you may want to do:
```python
>>> for i in range(len(names)):
...     print names[i], values[i]
a 1
b 2
c 3
```

This is horrible, because you will get `IndexError` if the lists do not have the same length, though you could use a third built-in `min` to handle this, but the code would start to get hard to read. `zip` does this for you:
```python
>>> for name, value in zip(names, values):
...     print name, value
a 1
b 2
c 3
```

Better, no?

### With iterators

Note that zip returns a list, which can require a lot of memory since it copies everything.
```python
>>> zip(names, values)
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
```

To get an iterator, use the `izip` version from the itertools module.
```python
>>> from itertools import izip
>>> izip(names, values)
<itertools.izip at 0x1ee6830>
>>> list(izip(names, values))
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
```

### Length mismatch behavior

What happens if the list do not have the same length? zip stops.
```python
>>> names = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
>>> zip(names, values)
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
```

If you want a version who does not stop, use `izip_longest` from itertools:
```python
>>> from itertools import izip_longest
>>> list(izip_longest(names, values))
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), (None, 4), (None, 5), (None, 6)]
```

You can customize the *fill value* like this (`None` by default):
```python
>>> list(izip_longest(names, values, fillvalue='Y'))
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('Y', 4), ('Y', 5), ('Y', 6)]
```
