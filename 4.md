## enumerate

`enumerate` is, again, a builtin. It helps you iterate over iterables and provides you an index value.
First let's take a step back and review how to loop over stuff.

Suppose you have a list of names like this.
```python
names = ['a', 'b', 'c']
```
If you want to iterate over it to print the names, you can do this:
```python
for name in names:
    print name
#Output:
#a
#b
#c
```
Now, if you want to modify the list `names` during the iteration, you cannot you this technique, because you do not have the index of the current element.
Let's suppose we want to replace all `'b'` value by a `'d'`. You may code it like that.
```python
for i in range(len(names)):
    if names[i] == 'c':
        names[i] = 'd'
print names
#Output:
#['a', 'b', 'd']
```
This works, but there is better. First you may want to replace `range` with `xrange` to get an iterator rather than a list.
But there is even better, use `enumerate` to take care of the indexing! Here you go:
```python
for i, name in enumerate(names):
    if name == 'c':
        names[i] = 'd'
```
`enumerate` works with all iterables. It returns the `(index, element)` during iteration.

A use case I like for `enumerate` is to count line numbers when reading a file.
```bash
$ cat toto.txt
This is the first line.
Second line
```
Now let's open that file `toto.txt` using the very nice `with` statement (who will perform the open/close for us).
```python
with open('toto.txt') as f:
    for i, line in enumerate(f, start=1):
        print i, line.rstrip()
#Output:
#1 This is the first line.
#2 Second line
```
Note that the indexing starts at `0`, but here we want to start counting from `1`. `enumerate` has an optional `start` keyword argument to handle this.
