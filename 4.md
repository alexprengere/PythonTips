## enumerate

### Loops

`enumerate` is, again, a builtin. It helps you iterate over iterables and provides you an index value.
First let's take a step back and review how to loop over stuff.

Suppose you have a list of names like this.
```python
names = ['a', 'b', 'c']
```
If you want to iterate over it to print the names, you can do this:
```python
for name in names:
    print name
#a
#b
#c
```
Now, if you want to modify the list `names` during the iteration, you cannot use this technique. You need the *index* of the element.

Let's suppose we want to replace every `'b'` value by a `'d'`. You may code it like that.
```python
for i in range(len(names)):
    if names[i] == 'c':
        names[i] = 'd'
print names
#['a', 'b', 'd']
```
This works, but there is better. First you may want to replace `range` with `xrange` to get an iterator rather than a list.

But there is even better, use `enumerate`!

### enumerate

`enumerate` works with all iterables. It returns a `(index, element)` tuple during iteration.
```python
for i, name in enumerate(names):
    if name == 'c':
        names[i] = 'd'
```

### Exercise

A use case I like for `enumerate` is for counting line numbers when reading a file.
Suppose you have this simple file, and you want to print the line number next to each line.
```bash
$ cat toto.txt
This is the first line.
Second line
```
Here is a first very ugly version:
```python
f = open('toto.txt')
i = 0
for line in f:
    i += 1
    print i, line.rstrip()
f.close()
#1 This is the first line.
#2 Second line
```
6 lines of code, does the job. Note that `rstrip()` is used to remove the last `\n` at the end of each line.

Let's make a first revision which has nothing to do with `enumerate`.
Let's open that file `toto.txt` using the very nice `with` statement. It will perform the open()/close() for us.
This will remove one line of code and will reveal in the code the moment when the file needs to be open, with an indentation.
```python
with open('toto.txt') as f:
    i = 0
    for line in f:
        i += 1
        print i, line.rstrip()
```
Now let's use `enumerate` to get an index for each line:
```python
with open('toto.txt') as f:
    for i, line in enumerate(f, start=1):
        print i, line.rstrip()
```
Note that the indexing usually starts at `0`, but here we want to start counting from `1`.
`enumerate` has an optional `start` keyword argument to handle this.
