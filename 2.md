## map and list comprenhension

### map builtin

`map` is a Python builtin (meaning you can use it like that, without importing anything). But at the end of this tip, you will learn *not* to use it ;).

Map is used to apply a function to all element of a list (or any iterable). Let us suppose we have a function that doubles a number:
```python
def double(a):
    return 2 * a
```

Note that we could have used the `lambda` shortcut to define double:
```python
double = lambda a: 2 * a
```

And we have a list of numbers:
```python
L = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Then you can *map* (e.g. apply) the function `double` on the list `L` like this:
```python
>>> map(double, L)
[2, 4, 6, 8]
```

### List comprehension

There is a much more used/expressive/pretty way to express the map builtin in Python, through *list comprehension*, like this:
```python
>>> [double(n) for n in L]
[2, 4, 6, 8]
```

This syntax is close to the math set notation: `{ double(n) | n in L }`. The nice thing is that it is easily extensible, for example, filtering odd/even numbers:
```python
>>> [double(n) for n in L if n % 2 == 1]
[2, 6]
```

So to sum up, every statement using map can be converted using list comprehension:
```
map(func, iterable) ----> [func(n) for n in iterable]
```

### With iterators

One last thing. map returns lists, if you want to return an iterator, you have to use `imap`:
```python
>>> from itertools import imap
>>> imap(double, L)
<itertools.imap at 0x...>
>>> list(imap(double, L))
[2, 4, 6, 8]
```

Using list comprehension, if you want to get an iterator as well, you have to use () instead of [].
This is called a *generator expression*.
```python
>>> (double(n) for n in L)
<generator object <genexpr> at 0x...>
>>> it = (double(n) for n in L)
>>> list(it)
[2, 4, 6, 8]
```
