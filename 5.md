## ternary operators

### Wut?

If you already coded in C, you may now this syntax:
```c
var = condition ? value_1 : value_2;
```
This is just a shortcut for the more common:
```c
if (condition) {
    var = value_1;
} else {
    var = value_2;
}
```
It is clean, saves you 4 lines of code, and is called a *ternary operator*.
Well, it exists in Python too! Suppose you have the similar code:
```python
if condition:
    var = value_1
else:
    var = value_2
```
This is equivalent to:
```python
var = value_1 if condition else value_2
```
Note that the order of things is different from C! Also, it possible to use several ternary operators in a single statement in Python, but I don't think it is a good idea. It clearly is not readable, and readability is the goal of this.

### Exemple

```python
def clim_status(temp):
    return 'on' if temp > 28 else 'off'

clim_status(30) #'on'
clim_status(20) #'off'
```
